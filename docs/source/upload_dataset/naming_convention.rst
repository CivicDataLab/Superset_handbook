Naming convention
===================================

**The naming convention for the CSVs uploaded: **
1. The dataset’s name should be self-explanatory.
2. Indicate the time range of the data within the name of the dataset. Eg: UnionBudget_FY17_18
3. Indicate “tmp” in the name of the CSV is uploaded for a temporary use case. Delete the file after using it. Eg: AssamBudget_FY19_20_tmp
4. Delete the duplicated CSVs if they are not used in the dashboard.
